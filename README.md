## Instructions

To get started, open `designs.js` and start building out the app's functionality.

The starter code includes all required HTML input fields, as well as some basic styling.

## Contribution

We first define the variable, using `const` and `let` format. We used the id s that were available in HTML and CSS codes.

We then define a skeleton of the `makeGrid()` function using the defined variables.

After that, we add event listener to the corresponding DOM elements. 

We finilized the `makeGrid()` function via nested loop to produce the desired grid that is `submit` ed.
